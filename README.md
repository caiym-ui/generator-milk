The goal of this project is not to recreate a mobile component library. But by building component development tools and the development of some components to understand the components of the development process in all aspects.

Now the functions have been achieved (would see [here](https://github.com/milk-ui/milk-dev)):

1. initialize the component template.
2. support development environment debugging.
3. support testflow.
4. support packflow and component publish.


In the development process draws on a lot of good components library, for example:

- [UXCore](http://uxcore.coding.me/)
- [Ant Design Mobile](https://mobile.ant.design/)
- [Ant Design](https://ant.design/index-cn)
- [Mint UI](http://mint-ui.github.io/#!/zh-cn)
- [WeUI](https://weui.github.io/react-weui/docs/)

I would like to thank you very much!

And welcome [Issue](https://github.com/milk-ui/generator-milk/issues) & [PR](https://github.com/milk-ui/generator-milk/pulls).
